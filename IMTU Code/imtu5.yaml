       The IMTU5 code is meant to format the IMTU code as a Traveller UWP.
       This theoretically makes it easy for Traveller players to parse it.

      - Jump: >

           This field is composed of two 2-digit numbers.
           
           The first two digits represents the minimum size craft that can have jump drives.
           The most common size codes are:

           05  Torpedo-sized
           06  1-9 tons
           07  10-99 tons
           08  100-999 tons
           09  1000-9999 tons
           
           The last two digits represents the TL at which drop tanks or tankless systems
           does away with the need for jump fuel aboard starships.  A code of '01' 
           represents "never" or "unknown".
      
      -  Canon Quotient: |
      
          Format: 0-1234-5

   - Examples: |
          
          <pre>
          Eneri         0801 A-558A-5 A Im Va As Sota Core    585 Im T5 I
          
          Eneri plays using T5 as rules, in the canonical Traveller universe with mostly 
          Imperials, Vargr and Aslan. The major thread is Secret of the Ancients, with a 
          dab of Core Expedition. It's mostly Merchant.  Eneri has no gaming group info,
          or plays solo.  Jump minimum is in the 100s of tons, and tankless systems are unknown.
          Eneri is middle-of-the-road when it comes to the size and power of the Imperium
          and the presence of pirates, but believes there are many sophont races, and robots 
          are all-pervasive.  Eneri is also noncommittal about gearheadedness and AI,
          but is a strong believer in a good storyline.
                        
          Pasuuli       0516 A-4488-6 A Im Da Vi Xrch Cnsp     386 Im T5 I MT II
          
          Pasuuli plays with T5 and MT in the canonical TU with mainly Imperials, 
          Darrians, and Vilani.  The major threads are Xenoarchaeology and Conspiracies,
          in primarily merchant campaigns.  Jump minimum is torpedo-sized, and TL16 is the
          cutoff for tankless systems.  Pasuuli believes in a slightly small, less powerful
          Imperium, with a corresponding proportion of piracy, and a preponderence of 
          sophonts and robots.  Pasuuli isn't much of a gearhead, is a fan of story,
          and tends toward preferring AI.
