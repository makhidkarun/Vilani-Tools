The IMTU Code

VERSION 1.1, 15 APRIL 1998

The IMTU Code is a rip-off of the "Geek Code".  Display it 
on postings to the TML, so everyone knows where you're 
coming from!

So you think you are a Traveller geek (T-geek), eh?  The 
first step is to admit to yourself your T-geekiness.  No 
matter what anyone says, T-geeks are people too; T-geeks 
have rights.  So take a deep breath and announce to the 
world that you are a T-geek.  Your courage will give you 
strength that will last you forever.

How to tell the world you are a Traveller geek, you ask?  
Use the universal IMTU ("In My Traveller Universe...") code.  
By joining the T-geek organization, you have license to use 
this special code that will allow you to let other 
un-closeted T-geeks know who you are in a simple, codified 
statement.

The single best way to announce your T-geekhood is to add 
your IMTU code to your signature file and announce it far 
and wide.  But be careful, you may give other T-geeks the 
courage to come out of the closet.  You might want to hang 
on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.

INSTRUCTIONS

The IMTU code consists of several categories.  Each category 
is labeled with letters and some qualifiers.  Go through 
each category and determine which set of qualifiers best 
describes your Traveller Universe Preferences in that 
category.  By stringing all of these 'codes' together, you 
are able to construct your overall IMTU code.  It is this 
single line of code that will inform other T-geeks the world 
over of what a great T-geek you actually are.

Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with 
your universe exactly. Simply choose that qualifier that 
MOST CLOSELY matches it.  Also, some activities described in 
a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you do 
engage in others.  Each description of each qualifier 
describes the wide range of activities that apply, so as 
long as you match with one, you can probably use that 
qualifier.

Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there 
may (in the future) be a big difference between a 'tc' and a 
'TC'.

VARIABLES

Traveller Universes can seldom be quantified.  To facilitate 
the fact that within any one category the T-geek may not be 
able determine a specific rating, variables have been 
designed to allow this range to be included.

   @   for variable, said trait is not very rigid, may 
       change with time or with individual interaction.  For 
       example, Geeks who happen to believe that jump torps 
       exist but dislike using them might list themselves as 
       j+@.
       
   ()  for indicating "cross-overs" or ranges.  Geeks 
       who go from tc+ to tc-- depending on the situation (i.e. 
       mostly "tc+") could use tc+(--).  Another example might 
       be an tc++(**).  This would be a person who mostly uses 
       Classic Traveler, but also has an extensive collection of 
       other types of works.
       
   >   for 'wannabe' ratings.  Indicating that while the 
       geek is currently at one rating, they are striving to 
       reach another. For example, ?t4>+
       
   $   Indicates that this particular category is done 
       for a living.  For example, tg++$ indicates that the 
       person utilizes GURPS Traveller and gets paid for it.  
       Quite a lucky geek, for sure.

   @ is different from () in that () has finite limits within 
   the category, while @ ranges all over.

Section I: Rules Sets

CLASSIC TRAVELLER

   tc++  Bring back the LBBs!
   tc+   I appreciate this system and owe a lot to it.
   tc    "It's a resource".
   tc-   I just can't see any reason to use it.
   tc--  I wouldn't let my ugliest, smelliest dog sit on 
         these rules. It's a bane that would wreck Traveller 
         forever if allowed to thrive.

   ?tc   I don't know much about it.
   !tc   I ignore these rules.

Likewise for the remaining rule sets:
   tm MegaTraveller
   tn TNE
   t4 T4
   tg GURPS Traveller (for now, a mostly wannabe situation)
   tt Traveller 2300
   to Other rules set (CORPS, GW, etc)

OVERALL RULES USE

   ru++  The Traveller rules are the best.
   ru+   The Traveller rules are great.
   ru I use the Traveller rules, more or less.
   ru-   I have modified significant portions of most of the Trav rules.
   ru--  I use mostly other rules systems.

GEARHEADEDNESS

   ge++  Intricacy to the subatomic level, please!
   ge+   Details === Color
   ge Some detail gives me the flexibility I need for the game.
   ge-   Too many rules and steps stifles me.
   ge--  Ack!  Must we try to explain everything?

Section II: Canonicity

THE 3RD IMPERIUM 

   3i++  The 3I is a massive juggernaut, with an amazing tax
      base and thousands of SDBs in even minor systems.
      Interplanetary trade is robust.
      Many starports are huge city-sized affairs.
   3i+   The 3I is a powerful force to reckon with, with good
      control over most of its member worlds and the power
      to back its authority.
      Interplanetary trade is good on many worlds.
      Starports are planetary trade centers.
   3i The 3I is a stable confederation, held together by the
      nobility of its population, but not all-powerful and
      overall not wealthy.
      Interplanetary trade is regular.
      Starports are common.
   3i-   The 3I is a loose, vulnerable sprawl of worlds, which
      by the way is no worse off than the other interstellar
      states.
      Interplanetary trade exists on major worlds.
      Starports are significant on major worlds but not so
      massive.
   3i--  The 3I is a picture of gross mismanagement over impossible
      distances.  It's a wonder it held together so long.
      Interplanetary trade exists on only the best worlds.
      Starports are, on the whole, rather weak things.
   !3i   IMTU, the 3I doesn't exist or is irrelevant.

FTL DRIVES

   c++   I have the technical specs on jump drives right here...
   c+    Jump drives work sort of like this...
   c       Well, we have jump drives, but I never had to explain them.
   c-      FTL drive mechanics are a bit different out here.
   c--   We ride the sky in real slow beasties.

JUMP TONNAGE

   jt++  Jump torpedoes are not only canonical, but absolutely
         necessary for survival as we know it.
   jt+   Jump boats are do-able, economical in many cases, and cool.
   jt    Jumpships under 100t might exist in experimental form -- 
         but there are various problems with the design.
   jt-   Jumpships under 100t are too small, or they open too big 
         a can of worms.
   jt--  Small jumpships destroy Traveller.

   jt?   What's a jump torpedo?
   -jt+  Depends on my mood.

STARSHIP AUTOMATION

   au++  TL is sufficiently advanced that NO ONE need EVER crew
         a starship, unless it's just on the off chance of someone
         whacking the ship computers.
   au+   Starship automation is commonplace.
   au    Starship automation is in the trial phases, and has bugs
         to work out, or is quite expensive.
   au-   Starship automation doesn't work (for whatever reason).
   au--  Terrible things happen when the referee allows it!

EMPEROR STREPHON

   st++  Two timelines is a brilliant idea!
   st+   Two timelines will add flexibility to the game.
   st    Two timelines doesn't affect the game's popularity.
   st-   An extra timeline is a Bad Thing.
   st--  This will doom Traveller.
                (see code for GURPS Traveller)

LIFE SUPPORT

   ls++  Life support is very expensive and very difficult to work on!
   ls+   Life support is expensive and difficult to work on.
   ls    Life support can be do-it-yourself with off-the-shelf
         components.
   ls-   Life support is a fraction of the cost published.
   ls--  Life support is absorbed in other misc expenses.

PIRACY  

   pi++  Piracy exists and is rampant.  Anyone may commit piracy.
         Ship tracking and ID are uncommon.
   pi+   Piracy exists.  Antipiracy is mostly political or economic, and
         is inadequate.  Transponders may be changed or masked, or are
         not widespread or sufficient.
   pi    Piracy only exists in the vacuum of government or corporate 
         morals.
   pi-   Piracy is not sustainable.
   pi--  Piracy is impossible.

DROP TANKS AND TANKLESS SYSTEMS

   ta++  Starships only really need fuel for maneuver.
   ta+   "Tankless" systems are often used by large corporations.
   ta    Drop tank-assisted jumps are usable at TL14+.
   ta-   Drop tank-assisted jumps are expensive and dangerous.
   ta--  Drop tank-assisted jumps should be banned.

HERESY

   he++  The technological devices, social structures, and related
         background material IMTU require careful and detailed
         analysis to prove any link with Traveller whatsoever.
   he+   I'll diverge from canon when someone makes a convincing
         argument, or where canon is clearly broken.
   he    The material is fine as it is.
   he-   Divergence from published background is just asking for
         trouble.  There's no way a single GM can achieve the
         scope and consistency of the canon background, and trying
         to tweak "just one thing" inevitably leads to contradictions.
   he--  Marc Miller said it, I believe it, and that settles it.

Section III: Sapients

K'KREE

   kk++  I like K'Kree roasted over a spit with BBQ sauce.
   kk+   I like K'Kree only if it the meat is mixed into a haggis.
   kk    K'Kree have a funny aftertaste...
   kk-   K'Kree smell funny.
   kk--  All K'Kree should be catapulted into the sun.

HIVERS

   hi++  Hivers are the Puppeteers from _Tales of Known Space_.  Fun!
   hi+   Hivers are convincingly alien.
   hi    Hivers are okay.
   hi-   I have some problems with Hivers.
   hi--  All Hivers should be ground into haggis.

You get the picture.  Follow the above model for:
   as   Aslan
   va   Vargr
   dr   Droyne
   ith  Ithklur
   vr   Virushi
   ne   Newt
   etc.

SOLOMANI

   so++  The heirs of the galaxy.
   so+   Basically a bunch of great guys.
   so    You know how humans are...
   so-   A bunch of bad eggs.  Rabble.  Trash.
   so--  Should be targetted for termination.

Likewise for:
   zh Zhodani
   vi Vilani
   da Darrian
   sy Sylean
   etc.

Subsector Position

Coordinates are measured as absolute "latitude" and absolute
"longitude" from Normal, Illinois.  The following rule of thumb
can help with your calculations:

First Digits: 
              04 if you're in IL
              03 if you're in the midwest.
              05 if you're in North America.
                 (06 if your state has an ocean coast)
              07 if you're not in North America.
              02 if you're across an ocean.
                 (01 if your province is landlocked)
              08 if you're in a former state of the USSR.
                 (09 if your province is landlocked)

Second Digits:
              01 if you're North-East of Normal, IL
              02 if you're North-West of Normal, IL
              04 if you're North of Normal, IL
              05 if you're in Normal, IL
              06 if you're South of Normal, IL
